\section{Description of the Model}
\subsection{Gravity model}
In  social science -especially in international economics in trade simulations- it is a common and well established approach to simulate flows with a gravity model. The motivation behind it is the physical gravity force. This is defined by $F_G:=G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where G is the gravity constant, $m_i$ is the mass of the  i-Th body for $i=1,2$ and r is the distance between body 1 and body 2.

This leads to the general ansatz:
\begin{align*}
F_{ij}=G\frac{M_i^{\beta_1}M_j^{\beta_2}}{D_{ij}^{\beta_3}}
\end{align*}

($\leadsto$wikipedia)\newline

We transferred this idea to our situation by identifying the mass of a city to its population and used different definitions of distance. We dropped the constant at the beginning since we normalized the resulting flow anyway. As exponents we have chosen $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=1$ since with no experience this was as suitable as anything else.
