## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Every day we travel from our homes to Zürich. The train in the morning is often very crowded. Of corse, compared to other coutries, were all still traveling quite comftable. But since we are perfectionists and since the number of people traveling by train is rising, we asked our self if and how its possible to optimise the swiss train system.

Up to 1 million people per day travel by train in switzerland. And as already mentioned, this number is rising. More and more people are going to work by train, our mobility in general is rising. Is it possible to push our railsystem more to the limit? And if yes how do its properties change. Such as how resitent is this system then (komischi formulierig???????????) to delays? Do they accumulate? ( tscheggi ned ganz)so w From time to time there are more or less severe delations  (=>delays??) which sometimes lead to missing the next train or to long latency, espacilly when the delations add up. We are intrested how good the swiss railsystem is steeled against things like this.)


(As mentioned at the bottom <=?? am bode hää:-D ??) We have connected SBB for datas. Because we dont know if, and what kind of data we will get, we had to make two scenarios: 
Best case: We get a rich dataset with:

Worst Case: We dont get any data:
We will aply our ideas to a general gravity model, where the distance and population
determine the strength of connections (contigency plan).





## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

Look at the next chapter under Interesting parameters.


Note: If you raise the capacity of a system there is the possibility that the demand for it raises too. For example it would be possible that faster train connections would cause more people going to work by train. WE WONT look at this parameter because the human demands are way to coplex to model. This would go beyond the scope of our work.



## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
<ul>

Were trying to find out what modifications rise the capacity and the efficiency of a railsystem by applying networktheories and by changing parameters of our model (<= Booom, do we agree?). How does the system act then (in terms of the following paramerts(<=??sounds weird)

Interesting Parameters:
*Network/Connection/Connectiontypes (What networksystem has the railwaysystem? Ideas about changes from networktheory? How does it work with different structures)
*Delay Resitance (How does the system react? What can happen in the worst case?)
*Speed between stations
*holdtime at the station
*

   
Note: For the worst case 





## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

We expect that the railsystem fullfiths high standards and probably there will not be a better realistic solution (very pessimistic???:-D)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

We have connected SBB and kindly asked for datasets from schedules and load factors.
